This build system needs a fairly recent version of cmake, required to handle the Qt5 
extensions.

Before attempting these instructions you must have built the sister project, smidgen
(https://github.com/alynch4047/smidgen). Smidgen is constantly being updated
to support sqt, so make sure that your copy of smidgen is totally up to date.

Firstly the base CMakeLists.txt needs a small edit to point to the built smidgen
binary. Change the line 

set(SMIDGEN_EXE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../smidgen/install/smidgen)

so that it points to the smidgen binary. Here ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR} is the root
directory of the sqt project.

Now, run cmake:

$ cmake .

and then make install:

$ make install

at this point the build system needs a hand so

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./install/libs

and then we can run a test Qt5 application

$ ./examples/test_sqt
